## OBJECTIVE :-

Injuries and deaths resulting from road accidents are a growing public health problem in India. Road crash deaths have increased by 31% from 2007 to 2017. Surveys show that a 
10 min reduction of the medical response time can be statistically associated with an average 
decrease in the probability of death by one-third, both on motorways and conventional roads. We 
propose an accident mitigation system that can be used in post-accident vehicles to reduce the 
death rate due to road accidents. The proposed framework is a hybrid decision algorithm that 
enables the system to take accurate and precise decisions that save lives that matter. We use 2 
conditions to decide if the accident victim needs medical help or is safe. This valuable accident 
information is sent to the hospitals along with the GPS location to enable hospitals in a 5km 
radius around the accident zone to see the information and respond to the accidents immediately. 
This system will reduce the response time by at least 10 min thereby reducing the death rate by 
one-third of the present death rate.
